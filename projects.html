                                Mobile app that allows Texas A&M students to sell and purchase items through the app. Used Dart
                                and Flutter to create an app compatible with both apple and android phones, as well as a website.
                                Additionally learned to use various software such as Postman and Android Studio to demonstrate and
                                test individual functions of the app.

                                Created a personal website from scratch using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Learned to use classes and functions in HTML as well as the stylesheets in CSS. One of the most interesting part was the toggle button between the two pages and changing the style using one html file. Also, having the chatGPT write the code for a webpage was fun.

                                Created a website using React that output the shortest bus route when inputted the start
                                and end locations. The route could consist of one or more buses and it also considers the 
                                time to get on a different bus. The group used React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS and I was 
                                in charge of the UI and making the website easier to navigate for users. Also assisted in 
                                setting up the database software to store A&M's bus route information and retreive the 
                                correct routes in proper order.

                                Used Python and Java to find data driven solutions to problems dealing with the real-world problems for GM. Analysed data for damaged vehicles and tried to find the likely cause of wreckages and their possible solutions. After finding the results, we compiled the data into a document and presented it to the GM personel.

                                A mobile app that allows people to easily log and track their schedules and a to-do list in different categories such as work, personal, and groceries. Also add a chat function so people can find groups of people with similar interests and destress while talking about their hobbies. I want to name this app Everyday because it would be nice to have a easily accessible app that tracks all your to-dos and schedules and lets you take short breaks by chatting with people about what you are interested in.

                                Make a website or app that makes it easy for people to blog their everyday lives or use it like a web instagram or diary where they record special days or events. You will be able to make the blog public or keep it prvate for yourself. It's similar to instagram but users will be able to format it with pictures and texts however they like. For example, they can have only pictures like <a href="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0e0314_f6be02dce4304919a01bbaaad7ddd4ab~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_924,h_2073,al_c,q_90,enc_auto/0e0314_f6be02dce4304919a01bbaaad7ddd4ab~mv2.png" class="pdf">this</a> or have texts as well like <a href="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/creative_blog_02.jpg" class="pdf">this</a> or <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/fashion-jackson-website-homepage-1024x637.webp" class="pdf">this</a>.
