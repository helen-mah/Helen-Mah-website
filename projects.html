                                Created a personal website from scratch using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Learned to use classes and functions in HTML as well as the stylesheets in CSS. One of the most interesting part was the toggle button between the two pages and changing the style using one html file. Also, having the chatGPT write the code for a webpage was fun.

                                Created a website using React that output the shortest bus route when inputted the start
                                and end locations. The route could consist of one or more buses and it also considers the 
                                time to get on a different bus. The group used React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS and I was 
                                in charge of the UI and making the website easier to navigate for users. Also assisted in 
                                setting up the database software to store A&M's bus route information and retreive the 
                                correct routes in proper order.

                                Used Python and Java to find data driven solutions to problems dealing with the real-world problems for GM. Analysed data for damaged vehicles and tried to find the likely cause of wreckages and their possible solutions. After finding the results, we compiled the data into a document and presented it to the GM personel.
