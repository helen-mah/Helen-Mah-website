                    Python: Python is the first programming language I learned in sophomore year of high school 
                    and have been working with it since. I have taken multiple courses in Python including CSCE411, 
                    CSCE421, and CSCE430. In addition, I work as a peer mentor for CSCE102, a beginner Python 
                    course for all freshmen in General Engineering. As a peer mentor, I assist students in coding 
                    labs and hold office hours for students to ask any programming-related questions.

                    C++: I took my first C++ course as a freshman at Texas A&M and continued to take higher level 
                    courses such as CSCE221 and CSCE313. In the Competitive Programming class, I am learning to use 
                    C++ to code efficient, low time complexity code in a given time to solve a problem.

                    LaTeX: I have been using LateX for about six years to format homework submissions and project 
                    write-ups. I learned to format paragraphs, formulas, diagrams, and images. I am able to create
                    documents how I want them to look like and perform the necessary tasks in LaTeX.

                    Dart & Flutter: I learned Dart and Flutter in the summer 2022 while working on a personal project. 
                    Being relatively new language and platform, I had to use their official website for tutorials and 
                    examples. Similar to React, Flutter is a platform that can be used to build mobile apps and website. 
                    Dart is the programming language used for the Flutter platform.

                    Other technical skills I have worked with and am familiar with are Java, React, Javascript, 
                    HTML, CSS, and Pandas.

                    I currently have multiple areas of interest in the technical field including Software 
                    Engineer, Web Developer, and Data Analytics. Specific areas also include Artificial 
                    Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and Data Science. I'm looking forward to 
                    exploring and learning about more opportunities
